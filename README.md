# Turtlebot-Autonomy

This is a ROS Package. It works with ROS-melodic.

Clone this in your catkin workspace and run `catkin_make`.

# Project Goals

- Have a turtlebot simulator and develop autonomy for this robot in an indoor environment
- Keep the code modular so that it can be also implemented on another type of robot or another environment.
