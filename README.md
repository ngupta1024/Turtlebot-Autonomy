# Turtlebot-Autonomy

This is a ROS Package. It works with ROS-melodic.

Clone this in your catkin workspace and run `catkin_make`.

# Project Goals

- Have a turtlebot simulator and develop autonomy for this robot in an indoor environment
- Keep the code modular so that it can be also implemented on another type of robot or another environment.

# Contribution

Break down bigger tasks into smaller ones. The bigger tasks will fall under a project or a new project will be made for them.
Create an issue for the sub-task you want to accomplish.
Make your own branch for each sub-task and make a Pull request to merge to the master branch.

Use your best judgement as these are not rock hard rules.
